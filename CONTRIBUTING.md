# Contributing to Autonomous AJ's Square API Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
